    <p>Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955 and grew up in London.
        He studied physics at Oxford University and later became a software engineer. <br>
        Berners-Lee first described the concept of a global system, based on the concept of
        â€˜hypertext which would allow researchers everywhere to share information in 1980.
        He built a prototype called <br> â€˜Enquireâ€™. In 1984, he published a paper called
        â€˜Information Management: A Proposalâ€™ in which he created a system for sharing
        and distributing information globally. He named it the World <br> Wide Web.
        First website was created in 1991. You can visit the website here:

        at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. <br> Currently, he is director of the World
        Wide Web Consortium that he founded and a Professor in the Computer Science Department
        at the University of Oxford.</p>
